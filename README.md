# ⚛️ React

This repository is a curated collection of **mini React projects**, each organized in its own folder. These projects were built to practice and demonstrate core React.js concepts like state management, component design, and JSX rendering.

## 📁 Project List

Each folder contains a self-contained project. Here's what you'll find:

### 🌐 1. `static-web-page`
A responsive, static single-page website built using React components. Great for understanding layout and basic component structure.  
**Tech Used:** Component reuse, layout with CSS

### 🧳 2. `travel-journal`
A static travel journal layout that displays a list of travel destinations with photos and descriptions.  
**Tech Used:** JSX, component props, styling

### 📝 3. `todo-app`
A simple To-Do List that lets users:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks  
**Tech Used:** React state, props, event handling, conditional rendering

🍳 **4. yourpersonalchef**  
An AI-powered recipe generator where users input a list of ingredients and get personalized recipe suggestions in real-time using Hugging Face models.  

**Features:**
- Takes multiple ingredients as input  
- Calls a language model API to generate recipes dynamically  
- Displays suggestions only if enough input is given  
- Handles loading states and errors  

**Tech Used:**  
React state & conditional rendering, API integration (Hugging Face Inference API), environment variables, dynamic UI updates

### 😂 5. `meme-generator`  
A dynamic meme generator that fetches random meme templates from an external API and lets users add custom top and bottom text.
